# duplicity-s3-backup-scripts
A collection of scripts used to automate backups on Linux using duplicity and Amazon S3

## About
This repository contains a collection of scripts I've developed/collected to backup important files on my Manjaro Linux desktop to Amazon S3 storage using the duplicity backup tool. Inspiration for these scripts came from a guide provided by Digital Ocean located at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-duplicity-with-gpg-to-securely-automate-backups-on-ubuntu.
